# Time Online Server

## What is it?

The project is a simple REST API built as part of the DL Master Class.  
It handles GET & POST requests to the `/api` route.

## How to start

Clone the repo locally and install all dependencies:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/milen.nenkov/time-online-server.git
cd time-online-server
npm i
```

Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) locally in order to use the DB

To start the server run the following command

```
npm run dev
```

This will compile the app in the dist folder and run the server.js file with `nodemon`.  
Any changes made to the files will recompile and restart the server.
